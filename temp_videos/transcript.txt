Data scientists versus software engineer, interview prep.  What coding languages do you need to know?  When I was in college, I always used Java  for my technical interviews, but now that I'm graduated,  I use Python because it's faster to code in.  For data scientists interview, you of course need to know SQL Python R,  but the chances are that at the interview,  you're going to have to pick between Python or R,  so I say pick one and practice on that.  What tools do you use for interview prep?  I love using strata scratch and hacker rank.  They are my favorite.  Lead code is great, but it's not really designed  for data scientists' interviews.  For me, it's all lead code, all that one source,  and also geeks for geeks.  Do you need to know DSA for interviews?  Absolutely.  Absolutely not.  Do you need to prep for case studies?  Large part, no, but there are a few exceptions  like certain financial institutions.  For data scientists' interview,  absolutely you need to prepare for case studies  because a lot of the interviews are surrounded  for problem solving, so case studies are a must.  Data science, boo!  Stop engineering, boo!  Is it tough to find a job in this market?  Absolutely, especially for entry level,  but my advice is to prepare your portfolio  so you can stand out from rest of the group.  The market is tough, but I know a lot of people  who have gone hired and are really boils down to  who you know and your network.  Amazing.
